# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Currently supported versions:

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.0.x   | Yes       |
| < 1.0   | No        |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of FraudGuard AI seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Please Do NOT:

- Open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
- Disclose the vulnerability publicly before it has been addressed

### Please DO:

1. Email us directly at: murillo.aaron102@gmail.com
2. Provide detailed information including:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect:

- Acknowledgment: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- Updates: We will send you regular updates about our progress
- Timeline: We aim to address critical vulnerabilities within 7 days
- Credit: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

1. Never commit secrets to version control

   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Keep `.env` files out of git (already in `.gitignore`)
   - Use secrets management systems (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)

2. Generate strong secrets

   ```bash
   # Generate a secure SECRET_KEY
   python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
   ```

3. Use HTTPS in production

   - Always use TLS/SSL for API endpoints
   - Configure proper SSL certificates
   - Enable HSTS headers

4. Enable authentication

   - Set `REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATION=true` in production
   - Use strong JWT secrets
   - Implement proper API key management

5. Configure rate limiting

   - Enable rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Set appropriate limits based on your use case
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

6. Database security

   - Use strong database passwords
   - Restrict database access to application servers only
   - Enable SSL for database connections
   - Regular backups with encryption

7. Keep dependencies updated

   ```bash
   # Check for security vulnerabilities
   pip install safety
   safety check

   # Update dependencies
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

### For Development

1. Use separate environments

   - Never use production credentials in development
   - Use different SECRET_KEY for each environment
   - Isolate development databases

2. Run security scans

   ```bash
   # Run Bandit security scanner
   make security-scan

   # Or manually
   bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
   ```

3. Pre-commit hooks

   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit hooks
   make install-hooks

   # This will automatically:
   # - Check for private keys
   # - Scan for security issues
   # - Validate configurations
   ```

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- JWT Authentication: Secure token-based authentication
- Rate Limiting: Protection against brute force and DDoS attacks
- Input Validation: Pydantic models for request validation
- SQL Injection Protection: SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- CORS Configuration: Configurable cross-origin resource sharing
- Security Headers: Automatic security headers (X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Password Hashing: bcrypt for secure password storage

### Monitoring & Alerting

- Audit Logging: All API requests are logged
- Anomaly Detection: Monitor for unusual patterns
- Health Checks: Regular health monitoring
- Metrics: Prometheus metrics for security events

## Known Security Considerations

### API Keys in Configuration Files

- All example configuration files use placeholder values
- Real secrets must be provided via environment variables
- Never use default values in production

### Database Migrations

- Review all migrations before applying to production
- Test migrations in staging environment first
- Backup database before running migrations

### Third-Party Dependencies

- We regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Run `safety check` to scan for known vulnerabilities
- Review dependency changes in pull requests

## Security Checklist for Production

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All secrets are set via environment variables
- [ ] `SECRET_KEY` is a strong, randomly generated value
- [ ] `DEBUG=false` in production
- [ ] `REQUIRE_AUTHENTICATION=true` is enabled
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured
- [ ] HTTPS/TLS is enabled
- [ ] Database uses strong passwords
- [ ] Database connections use SSL
- [ ] Firewall rules are properly configured
- [ ] Only necessary ports are exposed
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are set up
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plans are in place
- [ ] Security scanning is part of CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Logs are being collected and monitored
